# Quantiva

## Project Description
Quantiva is a platform designed to simplify investing through the PEA (Plan d’Épargne en Actions), a tax-efficient investment account for French investors. The project aims to democratize financial investment by offering users data-driven insights, portfolio optimization, and educational tools to make better investment decisions.

Our objective is to combine finance and technology to help users optimize their portfolio performance within their PEA. Then, the idea would be to extend its use for CTO.

## Project Summary

#### Context
In France, over 7.5 million people have a PEA account, yet few actively manage it. Many investors lack tools to visualize performance, compare portfolios, or optimize allocations.

#### Solution
Quantiva provides:
- Portfolio simulation and optimization from a selected set of stocks
- Chart of weight and sector allocation for diversification insights
- Performance tracking of the portfolio over time

#### Target Users
Individual investors seeking to understand, simulate, and improve their PEA performance.

#### Business Model
• Freemium model — core simulation tools are free, while advanced analytics are available through a premium subscription (€12/month).

• Monetization begins after the MVP phase, with a projected growth from 100 to 600 paying users in the first year.

## Setup Instructions

#### 1) Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/romainrocton/European-Stocks-Selector-Optimizer
```

#### 2) Install dependencies

```

#### 3) Run the application
```bash

```

## Usage Instructions
1. Launch the website.
2. Select a list of stocks to include in your simulated portfolio.
3. The app will:
     - Compute the optimized weights based on the optimization you chose.
     - Display allocation charts by stock and sector.
     - Show portfolio performance over time (returns, volatility, etc.).
